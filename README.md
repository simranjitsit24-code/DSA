# DSA - Data Structures and Algorithms

Daily practicing DSA problems in LeetCode.

## Repository Structure

This repository contains implementations of common data structures and algorithm patterns organized into separate files:

### 📁 Files

- **LinkedList.py** - Linked List implementations and common patterns
  - Singly and Doubly Linked Lists
  - Common operations: insert, delete, reverse
  - Problem patterns: cycle detection, merge sorted lists, find middle

- **Arrays.py** - Array problems and patterns
  - Two Pointers technique
  - Sliding Window problems
  - Binary Search
  - Kadane's Algorithm (max subarray)
  - Common patterns: Two Sum, Three Sum, intervals

- **Stacks.py** - Stack implementations and stack-based problems
  - Basic Stack and MinStack
  - Monotonic Stack patterns
  - Problems: valid parentheses, daily temperatures, largest rectangle

- **Queues.py** - Queue implementations and queue-based problems
  - Queue, Circular Queue, and Deque
  - BFS patterns
  - Problems: sliding window maximum, number of islands, shortest path

- **BinaryTrees.py** - Binary Tree and BST implementations
  - Binary Tree and Binary Search Tree
  - Tree traversals: inorder, preorder, postorder, level-order
  - Common patterns: height, balanced tree, LCA, path sum
  - Problems: diameter, serialize/deserialize, zigzag traversal
